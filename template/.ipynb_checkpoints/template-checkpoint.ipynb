    "# Introduction\n",
    "This is a template for an APA-style [iPyPublish](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish) manuscript. Feel free to check out the documentation and examples at that link; it's all very good. There you can find information on how to embed figures, code, tables, and more. References are managed using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) in concert with [Better BibTex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/). For now, you're going to want to edit the notebook's metadata in order to change what appears on the title page. In addition, the metadata includes `jupytext` configuration, so that you can automatically generate markdown and py:percent versions of this notebook automatically on saving -- assuming you have `jupytext` installed and correctly configured, that is!
